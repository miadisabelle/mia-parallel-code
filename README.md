## Why Parallel Code?

- **Use the AI coding tools you already trust** — [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), and [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli) — all from one interface.
- **Free and open source** — no extra subscription required. MIT licensed.
- **Keep every change isolated and reviewable** — each task gets its own git branch and worktree automatically.
- **Run agents in parallel, not in sequence** — five agents on five features at the same time, zero conflicts.
- **See every session in one place** — switch context without losing momentum.
- **Control everything keyboard-first** — every action has a shortcut, mouse optional.
- **Monitor progress from your phone** — scan a QR code, watch agents work over Wi-Fi or Tailscale.
- **Ask about code with any LLM** — the inline code Q&A feature supports [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (default) or [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io/) M2.7 (204K context) — configurable in Settings.

<summary><strong>How does it compare?</strong></summary>

| Approach                                           | What's missing                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multiple terminal windows / tmux**               | No GUI, no automatic git isolation — you manage worktrees, branches, and merges by hand |
| **VS Code extensions** (Kilo Code, Roo Code, etc.) | Tied to VS Code; no true parallel worktree isolation between agents                     |
| **Running agents sequentially**                    | One task at a time — blocks your workflow while each agent finishes                     |

## How it works

When you create a task, Parallel Code:

1. Creates a new git branch from your main branch
2. Sets up a [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) so the agent works in a separate directory
3. Symlinks `node_modules` and other gitignored directories into the worktree
4. Spawns the AI agent in that worktree

When you're happy with the result, merge the branch back to main from the sidebar.

<summary><strong>More features</strong></summary>

- Tiled panel layout with drag-to-reorder
- **Focus mode** — single-task layout with a clean two-column view on wide screens (`Ctrl+Shift+F`)
- Built-in diff viewer with inline review comments and per-commit navigation
- **Guided change tour** — click **Generate tour of changes** at the bottom right of a task's Changed Files panel to generate in the background while you work. **Automatic** scope includes the whole feature branch against its configured or detected base, including uncommitted work; on `main`, `master`, and `develop`, it includes only uncommitted changes. Choose **Current diff** to explicitly use the commit selector (All, Uncommitted, or a single commit). Uncaptured context stays omitted when reading a captured tour. Hover or focus the button for an explanation and the configured provider/model. The button shows a spinner and progress, then a green checkmark and **Start tour** when ready. Click **Start tour** to open the diff captured for the tour; it never opens automatically. Completed tours remain available when you close and reopen the tour; clicking the loading button cancels generation. Uses your configured code Q&A provider, aiming for 4–6 concise stops in one request with a dedicated 500,000-character prompt budget; inline Q&A keeps its 50,000-character limit. This is an app guard, not an exact token limit—provider context limits still apply. Larger diffs use compact excerpts and a five-minute timeout per part. Claude tour prompts are piped through stdin to avoid command-line size limits. Verbose logs include request sizes, time to first output, and total request duration, without code or response contents. Tours describe the supplied diff and do not verify test execution.
- **Steps tracking panel** — engineering-manager-style timeline of agent progress (writes to `.claude/steps.json`)
- **Notes panel per task** — jot ideas, then send the notes straight to the agent as a prompt
- **Canvas per task** — a Markdown file from the worktree rendered live as the agent writes it; edit it in place, or select a passage and send it to the agent with your question
- **Browser preview in the canvas** — run a local app in the task shell, open **+ → Browser**, and pick elements to reference in your prompt ([usage and limits](docs/browser-preview.md))
- **PR CI status watcher** — desktop notification when GitHub checks settle
- Shell terminals per task, scoped to the worktree
- **Direct mode** for working on the main branch without isolation, plus support for **folders without a git repo**
- **Existing worktree import** — bring already-created worktrees into Parallel Code
- **Sandboxing with project-specific Dockerfiles** — drop a `.parallel-code/Dockerfile` into the project and tasks run inside it
- **Coverage radar** — per-file test-coverage badges in the Changed Files panel
- **Configurable keyboard shortcuts** with per-agent presets
- 10 themes — Islands Dark, Minimal, Graphite, Midnight, Classic, Indigo, Ember, Glacier, Zenburnesque, Workbench
- State persists across restarts
- macOS and Linux

## Getting Started

1. **Download** the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/johannesjo/parallel-code/releases/latest):
   - **macOS** — `.dmg` (universal)
   - **Linux** — `.AppImage` or `.deb`

2. **Install at least one AI coding CLI:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/), or [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli)

3. **Open Parallel Code**, point it at a git repo, and start dispatching tasks.

<summary><strong>Antigravity CLI: run natively, not in Docker isolation</strong></summary>

Antigravity (`agy`) signs in interactively and caches credentials in your OS keyring (Keychain/libsecret). The keyring cannot be reached from inside a Linux container — it needs a secret-service daemon the agent container doesn't run — and `agy` has no API-key fallback, so **Docker-isolated Antigravity tasks cannot authenticate. Run Antigravity as a native (non-Docker) task.**

The bundled image still ships the `agy` binary, and `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli` (settings/plugins) is shared when "Share agent auth" is enabled, so Docker support is forward-compatible if a file-based or API-key auth path appears later.

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source</strong></summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/johannesjo/parallel-code.git
cd parallel-code
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+.

Phone access uses port `8777` in development (`npm run dev`) and `7777` in the installed app, so both can run together. Run `npm run build:remote` after changing the mobile UI, then use **Connect Phone** in the development app to get its connection link or QR code.
