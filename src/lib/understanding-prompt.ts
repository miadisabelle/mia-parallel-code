Required on every card: label, title, body, tone. Optional: whyItMatters, ${suggestQuestions ? 'questions, ' : ''}form, diagram, comparison, refs.
title states the card's takeaway as one short, complete claim of at most about twelve words, not a topic: "Each task gets its own working copy", not "Worktree isolation". Reading only the titles in order must give the whole argument; the body is the evidence for the claim.
Never exceed these character caps: label ${caps.label}, title ${caps.title}, body ${caps.body}, whyItMatters ${caps.whyItMatters}, text diagram source ${caps.textDiagram}, mermaid diagram source ${caps.mermaidDiagram}, comparison side label ${caps.comparisonLabel}, comparison side text ${caps.comparisonText}. At most ${caps.refs} refs per card. Output that exceeds a cap is rejected outright.
${suggestQuestions ? `questions is optional: suggest 0-${caps.questions} short, specific questions of at most ${caps.question} characters each that explore a real boundary, trade-off or assumption tied to this card. Do not repeat answered facts or ask generic questions. Omit questions when nothing useful remains to ask.\n` : ''}tone is exactly one of: "neutral" (plain explanation), "important" (the reader must not miss this), "risk" (something can break, cost time or lose data), "uncertainty" (genuinely unknown or merely assumed), "mechanical" (dry plumbing detail, low attention; keep its body to one or two sentences).
form gives different ideas different shapes. Omit it for an ordinary card; otherwise it is exactly one of:
- "takeaway": one claim that stands on its own; the body is a single supporting sentence.
- "comparison": before/after or two choices; requires "comparison" with exactly two sides, each a short label and the consequence of that side. The body is a one- or two-sentence caption.
- "flow": a mechanism; requires a diagram, which becomes the card's main content. The body is a one- or two-sentence caption.
Let the evidence carry the card: when a diagram or comparison shows the point, do not repeat it in prose.
Write decision-ready understanding, not documentation:
- Omit anything that would not change a high-level decision. Compression is the point.
- One idea per card. If a card needs "and", split it or drop the weaker half.
- Concrete before abstract: trace one real case, then name the pattern.
- Explain causality as A -> B chains, not as lists of features.
- Use contrast ("why not X", before/after) wherever it is faster than prose; it exposes trade-offs the reader has to judge.
- Show boundaries: where responsibility changes hands, and what crosses.
- Surface uncertainty only when it is real, with tone "uncertainty". Never hedge for safety.
- diagram only when it is faster than prose. Prefer kind "text": arrows and indented trees, rendered as-is. Use kind "mermaid" only for topology, and keep it to a few nodes.
- refs are optional hints: worktree-relative "filePath" plus an optional "line". Include one only when it materially helps the reader find the thing. Never invent paths or lines.`;
