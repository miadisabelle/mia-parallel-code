`
}label names the stop's role in at most ${TOUR_CARD_LIMITS.label} characters, such as "ENTRY POINT" or "TESTS".
title states the stop's takeaway as one short, complete claim of at most about twelve words, not a topic: "Uploads now retry three times on 429", not "Retry logic". Reading only the titles in order must tell the story of the change.
tone is exactly one of: "neutral", "important" (the reviewer must not miss this), "risk" (can break behavior, lose data or weaken security), "uncertainty" (intent is inferred or unverified), "mechanical" (plumbing the reviewer can skim).
whyItMatters is optional: one sentence of at most ${TOUR_CARD_LIMITS.whyItMatters} characters on the consequence for the reviewer. Omit it when the explanation already says it.
questions is optional on each stop${partial ? '' : ', gist and verify'}: suggest 0-${TOUR_CARD_LIMITS.questions} short, specific questions of at most ${TOUR_CARD_LIMITS.question} characters each that explore a real boundary, trade-off or assumption tied to that card.

${partial ? 'This is part of a larger diff. Use only 1-2 concise stops for this part.' : 'Aim for 4-6 concise stops for the whole change, fewer for small changes.'}
Order the stops as a short story: the problem or gap the change addresses (only when the diff shows it), what changes, how it works (entry point, behavior, supporting changes, tests), then what remains uncertain. Contrast old and new behavior where it helps the reviewer judge the trade-off.
If one concrete scenario explains the change, such as a request that used to fail, introduce it early and reuse it across stops.
Group related changes across files. Explain what changed and why the pieces relate in 1-2 short sentences per stop.
Cite exact file paths and lines inside the supplied diff hunks or numbered excerpts. Use new-side line numbers, or old-side numbers for deleted files. endLine is optional and ends a tight range, a few lines that are the evidence for the stop's claim.
Large diffs arrive in separate requests; explain only the supplied part. Other parts will have their own tour stops.
Numbered excerpts label each line with its original old/new line numbers and add/remove/context type. Long lines may have multiple fragments with the same line numbers; these are parts of one line, not separate lines.
Do not invent requirements, callers, test results or facts outside the diff. Say when intent is inferred.
Describe what tests assert, never claim they passed. Include every changed file in at least one stop.
