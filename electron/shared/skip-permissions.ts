/**
 * Which flag each built-in agent CLI takes to skip its own permission prompts.
 *
 * Lives here rather than beside `DEFAULT_AGENTS` because the renderer needs the
 * same answer: it builds an agent's launch args synchronously at spawn time,
 * and `electron/ipc/agents.ts` imports `child_process`, so it cannot reach it.
 * One table means both processes resolve an agent's flags identically instead
 * of each call site reading whatever `AgentDef` it happens to be holding.
 *
 * A command absent from this table takes no such flag. `opencode` is the
 * built-in example: it is deliberately not listed rather than listed as empty.
 *
 * A `Map` rather than an object literal because `command` is free text from the
 * custom agent editor: an object lookup resolves inherited keys, so an agent
 * named `constructor` or `toString` would read back a prototype member instead
 * of nothing. `Map` has no such keys to inherit.
